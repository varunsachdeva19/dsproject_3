# NFL Receiver Dashboard

This app is a dashboard that runs an analysis on any desired WR or TE who has logged at least 30 total targets in the 2020 season. Player info, a game log, and six visualizations of various statistics are displayed for the selected player.

This app was created using python and the open-source app framework, streamlit. It solely relies on [nflfastR](https://www.nflfastr.com/) data, managed by [Ben Baldwin](https://twitter.com/benbbaldwin) and [Sebastian Carl](https://twitter.com/mrcaseb).
